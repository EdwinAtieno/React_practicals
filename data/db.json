The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "Once upon a time, there was a developer named Sarah who needed to build a new feature for her web app. The feature required her to display a large amount of data in a table, and she wanted the table to be fast and responsive.\n\nSarah decided to use React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to implement the feature. She began by creating a new React component for the table, and added some code to fetch the data from a remote API.\n\nNext, Sarah added a search bar to the table so that users could filter the data by a specific keyword. She used the useState hook in React to manage the search query, and added a useEffect hook to fetch the filtered data whenever the query changed.\n\nWith the basic functionality in place, Sarah started working on optimizing the performance of the table. She noticed that the table was re-rendering every time the search query changed, even if the data being displayed didn't actually change.\n\nTo fix this, Sarah added a shouldComponentUpdate method to the table component, which would only re-render the table if the data had actually changed. This made the table much faster and more responsive, and the users of the web app were happy with the improved performance.\n\nSarah was proud of her work, and she continued to improve and refine the table component, making it even more powerful and user-friendly. And they all lived happily ever after.",
